This paper estimates the surface area of a 3D model based entirely on two images. The mathematical concepts used include:

* **Double integration**: Used to calculate the surface area of 3D functions, including revolutions of circular functions and more complex shapes.
* **Polar integration**: Employed to model spiral and wavy sections of the clock.
* **Surface area of revolution**: Applied to model surfaces such as cones and cylindrical hinges.
* **Trigonometric ratios**: Sine and cosine rules used to calculate angles and sides in irregular geometries.
* **Arc lengths**: Derived from functions like parabolas and quartic equations.
* **Graph transformations**: Including scaling and reflection of polynomial and trigonometric functions.
* **Parabolic, quartic, and quintic functions**: Used to model various sections of the clock's front face and wavey details.
* **Geometry of cones, cylinders, and trapeziums**: Approximating golden hinges and ornament sections.
* **Pixel analysis**: Using images and tools like GIMP and rapidtables.com for precise measurement of dimensions.
* **Modern tools**: Integration with online graphing software like GeoGebra and Desmos to plot and analyze complex shapes.

This paper was graded as 18/20 (90%) by the IB. I think it is a good starting point for anyone attempting to model 3D properties such as depth using only 2D images.
